# dotfiles

These are dotfiles originating from [thiderman][thiderman]. They primarily
concern [vim][vim], [zsh][zsh] and [tmux][tmux], but also contain haxings for
[git][git], some general tiling window manager setups, and finally some
generally helpful scripts.

Please see the directories in this repository for specific READMEs for them.

In action: A tmux split showing a [doge][doge] and writing this very README in
vim. The window decorations are from [herbstluftwm][herbst], the terminal is
[rxvt-unicode][urxvt] and the font is the beautiful [Inconsolata][inconsolata].
