# zshrc local user configuration by Lowe Thiderman (daethorian@ninjaloot.se)
# Released under the WTFPL (http://sam.zoy.org/wtfpl/).
#
# <github link>

# This is a file containing user specific configuration for zsh. While the
# original intent is for .zshrc to contain all this, it becomes troublesome
# whenever you want to share your zshrc and those you share it with make
# changes.

# The best way to use this file is to copy it to ~/.config/zsh/$USER.conf and
# mofify it to your needs. Whenever the zsh is updated (from git ;)), your
# changes will be intact and you can diff properly without conflicts. Sweet.
# $USER.conf files will be sourced from the main zshrc in favor of this file.

# Within this file there are several boolean togglers. If not stated otherwise,
# they need to be set _and_ have a value of true. This way both commenting them
# out and setting them to false will have immediate effect.

# User information {{{
	# Your main alias. If $USER is the same as $ALIAS, the prompt will save
	# space and only show the hostname instead of both the username and the
	# hostname.
	export ALIAS='daethorian'

	# Your main remote site. Currently not widely used. Backup and connection
	# testing functions are planned.
	export REMOTE='ninjaloot.se'

	# Your email adress. Currently unused.
	export EMAIL="${ALIAS}@$REMOTE"
# }}}
# User prompt settings {{{
	# Your prompt mode. Currently four modes are supported:
	# #0: A simple % (user) or # (root). No more, no less. Used for minimalism.
	# #1: $USER@$HOST $PWD. Identical to Gentoos basic bash prompt. Used for consoles.
	# Will not expand back to only $HOST if $USER and $ALIAS match.
	#
	# #2: The default prompt. Uses double rows and is pretty advanced.
	# Always shows current machine, current PWD and a clock.
	# It also has several situational modules:
	#     # Exitstatus. Shown whenever exitstatus is non-zero.
	#     # Jobs. Shown whenever you have backgrounded jobs.
	#     # Mail. Shown whenever there are files in any maildir in $MAIL.
	#     # Battery. Shown if laptop and if battery is toggled.
	#
	# Mail and battery requires simple setting up and are ignored otherwise.
	#
	# #3: The CVS prompt. Identical to #2, but inserts CVS info in a middle row.
	# It is automatically toggled whenever you enter a directory that contains
	# CVS files, and automatically reverted whenever you leave.
	#
	# You can toggle between the prompts using the simple p() shell function
	# using numerical arguments. If you give a boolean argument (true/false),
	# the prompt will set $PKEEP. If $PKEEP is true, the prompt will not
	# try to automatically switch to the CVS prompt.
	export PMODE=2
	export PKEEP=false

	# Force the console to use prompt #1
	export FORCE_CONSOLE=true

	# Force mobile connections (any $TERM that is 'xterm') to use prompt #0.
	export FORCE_MOBILE=false

	# Make root timeout after 180 seconds for security reasons.
	# Unset (and/or comment out here) to disable.
	export ROOT_TIMEOUT=180
# }}}
# User editor {{{
	# Your editor. If an alias exists for it, it will be unaliased to avoid
	# confusion and breakage. (if one exists and you run which on it, which will
	# not return an absolute path to the application)
	local _EDITOR='vim'

	if alias $_EDITOR &> /dev/null ; then
		unalias $_EDITOR
	fi

	if which $_EDITOR &> /dev/null ; then
		export EDITOR=$(which $_EDITOR)
	else
		export EDITOR=$(which vi)
	fi

	# Your visual editor. Nuff said.
	export VISUAL=$EDITOR
# }}}
# User directories {{{
	# Your mail directory. If set and exists, the prompt will look for new mail
	# in maildirs within it. The principle is simple and very primitive, so any
	# file within a directory named new/ inside $MAIL will trigger the mail
	# count.
	# Not that unlike most directories bound to the zsh conf, $MAIL will not be
	# created automatically.
	export MAIL="$HOME/mail"

	# Your log directory. zsh will place it's history there instead of
	# cluttering the $HOME.
	export LOGS="$HOME/.local/logs"
# }}}
# User laptop settings {{{
	# Set if laptop. If false, no battery settings will take place.
	export LAPTOP=true

	# Battery settings.
	# If the file $BAT exists, the prompt triggers the battery module.
	# When triggered, it writes a simple cache to $BATC and uses this for $BATS
	# seconds. $BATT is the timestamp of when the cache was last reset.
	# The cache is mainly to not access battery files every time a prompt is
	# read.
	if [ -n "$LAPTOP" ] && $LAPTOP ; then
		export BAT='/tmp/battery'
		export BATC='/tmp/battery_cache' # Battery cache
		export BATT=0 # Battery timeout
		export BATS=30 # Battery shift
	fi
# }}}
# User multiplexer {{{
	# Your terminal multiplexer. If installed and you are not currently in it
	# (whether you are or not is decided if $TERM is equal to $MULTITERM) the
	# PWD in the prompt will be red. Unset $MULTI to disable.
	export MULTI='tmux'
	export MULTITERM='screen-256color'
# }}}
# User chpwd and path {{{
	# Your todo list. The defaults are specified for devtodo
	# (http://swapoff.org/DevTodo). If $TODO is installed and $TODOFILE is in
	# the current directory, $TODO is run on chpwd().
	export TODO='todo'
	export TODOFILE='.todo'

	# Your choice of other chpwd() command.
	# When I used lscmd() (included in main zshrc) and found out that 25% of all
	# the commands I ever used in zsh was ls, I figured that it could be more
	# effective. It takes some getting used to, but it is really worth it!
	export CHPWD=true
	
	# Your home bin. In the rc there are functions included that handles
	# installation and uninstallation of custom executables. If this is desired,
	# $HOMEBIN must of course be included in your path.
	export HOMEBIN="$HOME/.local/bin"

	# Your path. Remember to separate additional directories with a colon.
	local _PATH=$HOMEBIN

	# If $_PATH is not in $PATH, add it, but only once.
	if ! [[ $PATH =~ "$_PATH" ]] ; then
		export PATH=$_PATH:$PATH
	fi
# }}}
# User coreutils options {{{
	# It is not uncommon to always supply some arguments to common commands. ls
	# and grep needs colors, right?
	export LSOPTS='--color=auto --group-directories-first'
	export GREPOPTS='--color=auto'
# }}}
# User zsh specifics {{{
	# zsh specific directory that the core shell might use for dumping etc. Only
	# used when set.
	export ZDUMPDIR="$HOME/.local/share/zsh"

	# The completion system uses a cache file to speed up completion. To avoid
	# cluttering the $HOME, it is put inside $ZDOTDIR
	export COMPDUMP="$ZDUMPDIR/compdump"

	# Use the debugger?
	export DEBUG=true
